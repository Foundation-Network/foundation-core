# 🛡️ The Foundation ($FNDN) Whitepaper

**The Foundation** is a specialized Layer 1 blockchain built exclusively for the global pigeon racing community. Our mission is to digitize avian heritage and provide immutable race-timing infrastructure.

## 1. Governance & Integrity
*   **Genesis Admin:** 0xA628c56dCe86ec44430c4F0b7c7e9097BdcEBFe0
*   **Multi-Sig Treasury:** Major club funds require 3-of-5 signatures from elected officials for any movement over 10,000 $FNDN.
*   **Immutable Pedigrees:** Once a bird’s DNA hash and lineage are recorded, they cannot be altered or deleted.
*   **Fair Launch:** No hidden pre-mine. 70% of supply is reserved for race prizes and breeder rewards.

## 2. Technical Utility
*   **Race Entry Fees:** $FNDN is the native currency for all verified club race entries.
*   **Digital Banding:** Official club bands are linked to unique on-chain IDs.
*   **Proof of Arrival (PoA):** Race results are verified via a high-precision consensus engine that integrates with IoT-enabled lofts.

## 3. Network Architecture
Launched on the **Canopy Network**, utilizing shared security and NestBFT consensus. This ensures 100% uptime for racing logistics and global interoperability for elite bloodlines.
